# Description

This project involved the development of an online banking system. It consisted of three milestones, each with specific goals and deadlines. Milestone 1 focused on Requirements Engineering, where the team analyzed pain points faced by users and derived comprehensive requirements for the online banking system. The requirements covered modules such as Users and Information Management System, Credit Cards and Loans, Personal Financial Management, and Bill Payment and Donations. Additionally, the team aimed to make the system accessible to blind people.

Milestone 2 involved the design phase of the application, where the team applied concepts learned in Software Design and utilized different Design Patterns. Deliverables included a components diagram, class diagram, entity relationship diagram (ERD), and database schema for the online banking system.

In Milestone 3, the team created a prototype of the system's front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on designing a user-friendly interface and implementing UI/UX rules discussed in lectures and tutorials. The prototype showcased the features of the online banking system, and a video demonstration with voice-over was also submitted.

Throughout the project, the team collaborated on a shared GitHub repository and ensured adherence to project specifications and deadlines.

By successfully completing this project, the team gained valuable experience in analyzing problem scenarios, deriving requirements, translating them into design diagrams, and implementing a functional front-end for an online banking system.
